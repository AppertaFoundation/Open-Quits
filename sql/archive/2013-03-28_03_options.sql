However, information sharing also present risks in terms of whether information is being shared appropriately and potential loss of information and breaches of confidence.<br /> <br /> 1.2 <br /> It is important to ensure that all organisations are committed to protecting person identifiable information, whilst sharing information for the benefit of the public.  <br /> <br /> 1.3 <br /> The Cabinet Office Data Handling Procedures in Government Final Report  examined current data handling processes within government departments to identify areas for improvement.  It concluded that core measures should be in place to protect information, to enhance consistency of protection and transparency of that protection to others, supported by a culture that properly values, protects and uses data.  <br /> <br /> 1.4 <br /> The Thomas and Walport Data Sharing Review  of the use of person identifiable information in the public and private sector also identified a series of recommendations including the need to: <br /> - Ensure all organisations are as transparent and open as possible about how and with whom data are shared, with what authority, for what purposes and with what protections and safeguards<br /> - To clarify and simplify the legal framework governing data sharing, including provisions to guarantee better and more authoritative guidance for practitioners<br /> <br /> 1.5 <br /> The cross sector Information Sharing: Guidance for practitioners and managers  highlighted the need for an &ldquo;information sharing governance framework&rdquo; focusing on how to improve practice in information sharing both at the front line, but also on improving practice in information sharing within and between agencies.  One of the areas to be included in this would be an &ldquo;Information Sharing Code of Practice&rdquo; which would establish the organisation&rsquo;s intentions and commitment to information sharing and promote good practice when sharing person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 1.6<br /> The above guidance provides detailed advice for front line practitioners who have to make case-by-case decisions about sharing person identifiable information.  It does not however, deal in detail with arrangements for bulk or pre-agreed sharing of person identifiable information between IT systems or organisations. <br /> <br /> 2) PURPOSE<br /> <br /> 2.1 <br /> To meet some of the recommendations of the Data Handling and Data Sharing reviews by promoting a culture of secure and transparent information sharing.<br /> <br /> 2.2 <br /> To meet the requirements of the &ldquo;Information Sharing Code of Practice&rdquo; as detailed in the national Information Sharing Guidelines, whilst building on this by providing guidance on sharing of routine bulk flows of person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 2.3 <br /> To provide strategic level principles to be followed when sharing and/or jointly processing person identifiable information, as required to provide effective services to the public.<br /> <br /> 2.4 <br /> To highlight the importance to organisations of ensuring that all aspects of information security and confidentiality are considered for all new and existing instances of routine information sharing and support compliance with the stated principles.<br /> <br /> 2.5 <br /> To ensure a common understanding of the importance of information sharing between different sectors and to promote secure sharing between these sectors.<br /> <br /> 2.6 <br /> To provide guidance on good practice in sharing of routine information flows and a format against which organisations can review their current practices.<br /> <br /> 3) SCOPE<br /> <br /> 3.1 <br /> The guidance is specific to routine pre-agreed sharing of person identifiable information, but the importance of guidance to support case by case decisions around information sharing is also recognised and is covered in detail in the HM Governance document &ndash; Information Sharing: Guidance for practitioners and managers .<br /> <br /> 3.2 <br /> This guidance is provided for use across all public sector organisations in the North East and for any other organisation that would benefit from this guidance in managing information sharing arrangements.  It is endorsed by the agencies detailed on the front cover.<br /> <br /> 4) DEFINITIONS<br /> <br /> 4.1 <br /> Person identifiable information is factual information or expressions of opinion which relate to an individual who can be identified from that information or in conjunction with any other information coming into possession of the data holder.  This also includes information gleaned from a professional opinion, which may rely on other information obtained.  Personal information includes name, address, date of birth or any other unique identifiers such as NHS Number, Hospital Number, National Insurance Number, social care ID etc.  It also includes information which, when presented in combination, may identify an individual e.g. postcode, date of birth etc.<br /> <br /> 4.2 <br /> Information Sharing Agreements/Protocols are documented agreements which set out the basis for the secure transfer and use of person identifiable information across traditional organisational boundaries.<br /> <br /> 5) LEGAL FRAMEWORK<br /> <br /> 5.1 <br /> Agencies need to work effectively and efficiently together to provide services to individuals. Underpinning this approach is the requirement to disclose person identifiable information and/or jointly process person identifiable information in order to provide those services.  This needs to be carried out within the legislative and regulatory framework described below.<br /> <br /> 5.2 <br /> Administrative Law governs the actions of public authorities. In the context of data processing, a public authority must possess the statutory powers to provide a function which requires the intended processing of person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 5.3 <br /> All organisations, their employees, contractors and volunteers have a common law duty of confidence to their service users. This duty requires that person identifiable information is not used or disclosed for purposes of which an individual is unaware. Legitimate exceptions to the duty of confidence are when statute requires or permits the disclosure and where there is an overriding public interest (as established by case law).  Other legislation, particularly the Data Protection Act 1998, Human Rights Act 1998 and Freedom of Information Act 2000 confirms, extends or modifies this duty of confidence.  <br /> <br /> 5.4 <br /> The Data Protection Act 1998 regulates the processing of person identifiable information. Processing of person identifiable information must comply with the eight data protection principles and be in accordance with the rights of a data subject (see appendix 1).<br /> <br /> 5.5 <br /> Schedule 1 of The Human Rights Act 1998 confers the right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights).  This right can only be interfered with when there is a legal basis and it is necessary to do so for defined reasons.<br /> <br /> 5.6  <br /> More detailed guidance on legislation of relevance to information sharing can be found in NHS Information Governance &ndash; Guidance on Legal and Professional Obligations  and in Every Child Matters Information Sharing: Further Guidance on Legal Issues .  <br /> <br /> 6) KEY PRINCIPLES IN INFORMATION SHARING<br /> <br /> 6.1 <br /> Organisations using this guidance:<br /> <br /> 6.2 <br /> Organisational responsibilities<br /> <br /> 6.2.1<br /> Are committed to the sharing of person identifiable information in order to provide effective services to individuals and to the public at large, where this exchange is compliant with their powers and with their statutory responsibilities.<br /> <br /> 6.2.2 <br /> Will nominate a Senior Management representative/representatives responsible for ensuring security, data protection, data quality and confidentiality within their organisation.<br /> <br /> 6.2.3 <br /> Will ensure that employees, contractors, volunteers and all individuals for whom the organisation is responsible, are competent in handling person identifiable information.  This will include a basic understanding of their responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998, Human Rights Act 1998 and common law duty of confidence.<br /> <br /> 6.2.4 <br /> Will ensure that all aspects of information security and confidentiality are considered for all new and existing instances of routine information sharing and/or joint processing, and support compliance with the stated principles. <br /> <br /> 6.2.5 <br /> Where independent organisations provide services and do not have a recognised information governance framework e.g. small charities, the public sector organisation working with these bodies will support them in developing safe and secure ways of sharing information for the benefit of clients.  They will also have a responsibility through commissioning/contracting processes to be assured of the information governance arrangements of such organisations.<br /> <br /> 6.3 Justification for sharing<br /> <br /> 6.3.1 <br /> Will ensure that when person identifiable information is shared and/or jointly processed it will be in accordance with current legislation and common law duties.<br /> <br /> 6.3.2 <br /> Will clearly define the purpose and justification for information sharing, ensuring alternatives to sharing person identifiable information and the impact of sharing on all the relevant stakeholders are considered.<br /> <br /> 6.3.3 <br /> Will ensure that when sharing person identifiable information only the minimum required for the purpose is shared.<br /> <br /> 6.4 Fairness and transparency<br /> <br /> 6.4.1 <br /> Recognize that the public have rights of privacy and confidentiality and that sharing and/or joint processing of person identifiable information will respect these rights. <br /> <br /> 6.4.2 <br /> Will ensure that: <br /> - the public are informed of the purposes for processing their information e.g. through Fair Processing Notices<br /> - the public are informed which other organisations it may be disclosed to<br /> - consideration is given to whether consent of the data subject is required, and if so, will be sought [and complied with], unless there is a legal obligation that overrides this requirement  <br /> <br /> 6.4.3 <br /> Will develop procedures to address requests for further information, complaints and concerns raised by members of the public or by staff concerning the implementation of this guidance and any resulting information sharing agreements, procedures or guidance.<br /> <br /> 6.5 Information standards<br /> <br /> 6.5.1 <br /> Will ensure processes are in place to check the quality of the person identifiable information before it is shared.<br /> <br /> 6.6 Retention of shared information<br /> <br /> 6.6.1 <br /> Will ensure retention and disposal processes and schedules are agreed for the information being shared in line with statutory and organisational requirements.<br /> <br /> 6.7 Security of shared information<br /> <br /> 6.7.1 <br /> Will take responsibility for restricting access to person identifiable information that they process and the secure exchange of person identifiable information in line with principle 7 of the Data Protection Act (see appendix 1 and for further guidance see the international standard ISO 27001). <br /> <br /> 6.7.2  <br /> Will set out standards for the technical security arrangements that must be in place to protect shared information during transfer and within partner organisations.<br /> <br /> 6.7.3 <br /> Will ensure that all personal identifiable information is transferred in line with national security guidance and protocols.<br /> <br /> 6.8 Access to personal information<br /> <br /> 6.8.1 <br /> Will ensure that any impact on the ability to provide the public with access to their information is considered to ensure that the Data Protection right of individuals to seek access to their health or social care record is upheld.  <br /> <br /> 6.9 Freedom of Information<br /> <br /> 6.9.1 <br /> Will ensure that this guidance and any resulting information sharing agreements will be included in the organisations Freedom of Information Act Publication Scheme.<br /> <br /> 7 INFORMATION SHARING AGREEMENTS/PROTOCOLS<br /> <br /> <br /> 7.1 <br /> Information sharing is essential in order to provide effective services and protect the public.  Information sharing agreements are one way of ensuring that those organisations involved in information sharing have considered all the potential information governance issues around this sharing and are adhering to the current legal framework around information sharing.  <br /> <br /> 7.2 <br /> Not having an information sharing agreement does not mean that information cannot be shared.   As long as information sharing is being carried out legally, information sharing can occur.  This approach is supported by the Information Commissioners Office who states that &ldquo;All organisations can accomplish information sharing lawfully by adhering to governing legislation and the principles of the Data Protection Act whether an Information Sharing Protocol is in place or not.  An Information Sharing Protocol is a useful tool in some circumstances.  It is not a legal requirement&hellip;..An Information Sharing Protocol is a useful tool with which to manage large scale, regular information sharing &hellip;. It is not a useful tool for managing the ad hoc information sharing which all practitioners find necessary&rdquo; <br /> <br /> 7.3 <br /> A number of key factors relating to specific areas of information sharing should be considered and documented.  This may be in the form of an information sharing agreement, but could be documented in other ways e.g. spreadsheet, database etc.  It is up to those organisations involved in the information sharing to agree the most effective method for their organisations.  What is important, is that all of these areas have been considered prior to the sharing of this information.<br /> <br /> 7.4 <br /> Table 1 details the areas which should be considered for routine sharing of person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 7.5 <br /> The importance of the security of the information shared during transfer and whilst within organisations can not be overemphasised.  The Data Handling Review highlighted the need to minimise the storage of, and access to person identifiable information on removable media, such as laptops, computer discs and memory sticks which may be lost or stolen. It stated that where the use of removable media is unavoidable, encryption will be used and the information to be transferred will be the minimum necessary to achieve the business purpose. It also reported that where there is any reason where encryption cannot be applied, such material will be afforded physical protection using similar risk assessment processes as for large amounts of public money or precious objects.  It also stressed the need for improved security assessments/processes for IT systems which hold person identifiable information.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TABLE 1<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> AREA FOR CONSIDERATION        DESCRIPTION<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Contacts                                             Designated individuals within the sharing organisations responsible for sharing of the information<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Information to be shared                Type of person identifiable information to be shared, and whether sensitive.

('terms_and_conditions',	'a:4:{s:12:\"datetime_set\";i:1296495554;s:5:\"value\";s:23332:\"<p>Information Governance Guidelines.<br /> <br /> 1) Context<br /> <br /> 1.1 <br /> It is essential that organisations can share person identifiable information, to support more efficient access to services, to deliver care for those with complex needs and to protect the most vulnerable members of society.  However, information sharing also present risks in terms of whether information is being shared appropriately and potential loss of information and breaches of confidence.<br /> <br /> 1.2 <br /> It is important to ensure that all organisations are committed to protecting person identifiable information, whilst sharing information for the benefit of the public.  <br /> <br /> 1.3 <br /> The Cabinet Office Data Handling Procedures in Government Final Report  examined current data handling processes within government departments to identify areas for improvement.  It concluded that core measures should be in place to protect information, to enhance consistency of protection and transparency of that protection to others, supported by a culture that properly values, protects and uses data.  <br /> <br /> 1.4 <br /> The Thomas and Walport Data Sharing Review  of the use of person identifiable information in the public and private sector also identified a series of recommendations including the need to: <br /> - Ensure all organisations are as transparent and open as possible about how and with whom data are shared, with what authority, for what purposes and with what protections and safeguards<br /> - To clarify and simplify the legal framework governing data sharing, including provisions to guarantee better and more authoritative guidance for practitioners<br /> <br /> 1.5 <br /> The cross sector Information Sharing: Guidance for practitioners and managers  highlighted the need for an &ldquo;information sharing governance framework&rdquo; focusing on how to improve practice in information sharing both at the front line, but also on improving practice in information sharing within and between agencies.  One of the areas to be included in this would be an &ldquo;Information Sharing Code of Practice&rdquo; which would establish the organisation&rsquo;s intentions and commitment to information sharing and promote good practice when sharing person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 1.6<br /> The above guidance provides detailed advice for front line practitioners who have to make case-by-case decisions about sharing person identifiable information.  It does not however, deal in detail with arrangements for bulk or pre-agreed sharing of person identifiable information between IT systems or organisations. <br /> <br /> 2) PURPOSE<br /> <br /> 2.1 <br /> To meet some of the recommendations of the Data Handling and Data Sharing reviews by promoting a culture of secure and transparent information sharing.<br /> <br /> 2.2 <br /> To meet the requirements of the &ldquo;Information Sharing Code of Practice&rdquo; as detailed in the national Information Sharing Guidelines, whilst building on this by providing guidance on sharing of routine bulk flows of person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 2.3 <br /> To provide strategic level principles to be followed when sharing and/or jointly processing person identifiable information, as required to provide effective services to the public.<br /> <br /> 2.4 <br /> To highlight the importance to organisations of ensuring that all aspects of information security and confidentiality are considered for all new and existing instances of routine information sharing and support compliance with the stated principles.<br /> <br /> 2.5 <br /> To ensure a common understanding of the importance of information sharing between different sectors and to promote secure sharing between these sectors.<br /> <br /> 2.6 <br /> To provide guidance on good practice in sharing of routine information flows and a format against which organisations can review their current practices.<br /> <br /> 3) SCOPE<br /> <br /> 3.1 <br /> The guidance is specific to routine pre-agreed sharing of person identifiable information, but the importance of guidance to support case by case decisions around information sharing is also recognised and is covered in detail in the HM Governance document &ndash; Information Sharing: Guidance for practitioners and managers .<br /> <br /> 3.2 <br /> This guidance is provided for use across all public sector organisations in the North East and for any other organisation that would benefit from this guidance in managing information sharing arrangements.  It is endorsed by the agencies detailed on the front cover.<br /> <br /> 4) DEFINITIONS<br /> <br /> 4.1 <br /> Person identifiable information is factual information or expressions of opinion which relate to an individual who can be identified from that information or in conjunction with any other information coming into possession of the data holder.  This also includes information gleaned from a professional opinion, which may rely on other information obtained.  Personal information includes name, address, date of birth or any other unique identifiers such as NHS Number, Hospital Number, National Insurance Number, social care ID etc.  It also includes information which, when presented in combination, may identify an individual e.g. postcode, date of birth etc.<br /> <br /> 4.2 <br /> Information Sharing Agreements/Protocols are documented agreements which set out the basis for the secure transfer and use of person identifiable information across traditional organisational boundaries.<br /> <br /> 5) LEGAL FRAMEWORK<br /> <br /> 5.1 <br /> Agencies need to work effectively and efficiently together to provide services to individuals. Underpinning this approach is the requirement to disclose person identifiable information and/or jointly process person identifiable information in order to provide those services.  This needs to be carried out within the legislative and regulatory framework described below.<br /> <br /> 5.2 <br /> Administrative Law governs the actions of public authorities. In the context of data processing, a public authority must possess the statutory powers to provide a function which requires the intended processing of person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 5.3 <br /> All organisations, their employees, contractors and volunteers have a common law duty of confidence to their service users. This duty requires that person identifiable information is not used or disclosed for purposes of which an individual is unaware. Legitimate exceptions to the duty of confidence are when statute requires or permits the disclosure and where there is an overriding public interest (as established by case law).  Other legislation, particularly the Data Protection Act 1998, Human Rights Act 1998 and Freedom of Information Act 2000 confirms, extends or modifies this duty of confidence.  <br /> <br /> 5.4 <br /> The Data Protection Act 1998 regulates the processing of person identifiable information. Processing of person identifiable information must comply with the eight data protection principles and be in accordance with the rights of a data subject (see appendix 1).<br /> <br /> 5.5 <br /> Schedule 1 of The Human Rights Act 1998 confers the right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights).  This right can only be interfered with when there is a legal basis and it is necessary to do so for defined reasons.<br /> <br /> 5.6  <br /> More detailed guidance on legislation of relevance to information sharing can be found in NHS Information Governance &ndash; Guidance on Legal and Professional Obligations  and in Every Child Matters Information Sharing: Further Guidance on Legal Issues .  <br /> <br /> 6) KEY PRINCIPLES IN INFORMATION SHARING<br /> <br /> 6.1 <br /> Organisations using this guidance:<br /> <br /> 6.2 <br /> Organisational responsibilities<br /> <br /> 6.2.1<br /> Are committed to the sharing of person identifiable information in order to provide effective services to individuals and to the public at large, where this exchange is compliant with their powers and with their statutory responsibilities.<br /> <br /> 6.2.2 <br /> Will nominate a Senior Management representative/representatives responsible for ensuring security, data protection, data quality and confidentiality within their organisation.<br /> <br /> 6.2.3 <br /> Will ensure that employees, contractors, volunteers and all individuals for whom the organisation is responsible, are competent in handling person identifiable information.  This will include a basic understanding of their responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998, Human Rights Act 1998 and common law duty of confidence.<br /> <br /> 6.2.4 <br /> Will ensure that all aspects of information security and confidentiality are considered for all new and existing instances of routine information sharing and/or joint processing, and support compliance with the stated principles. <br /> <br /> 6.2.5 <br /> Where independent organisations provide services and do not have a recognised information governance framework e.g. small charities, the public sector organisation working with these bodies will support them in developing safe and secure ways of sharing information for the benefit of clients.  They will also have a responsibility through commissioning/contracting processes to be assured of the information governance arrangements of such organisations.<br /> <br /> 6.3 Justification for sharing<br /> <br /> 6.3.1 <br /> Will ensure that when person identifiable information is shared and/or jointly processed it will be in accordance with current legislation and common law duties.<br /> <br /> 6.3.2 <br /> Will clearly define the purpose and justification for information sharing, ensuring alternatives to sharing person identifiable information and the impact of sharing on all the relevant stakeholders are considered.<br /> <br /> 6.3.3 <br /> Will ensure that when sharing person identifiable information only the minimum required for the purpose is shared.<br /> <br /> 6.4 Fairness and transparency<br /> <br /> 6.4.1 <br /> Recognize that the public have rights of privacy and confidentiality and that sharing and/or joint processing of person identifiable information will respect these rights. <br /> <br /> 6.4.2 <br /> Will ensure that: <br /> - the public are informed of the purposes for processing their information e.g. through Fair Processing Notices<br /> - the public are informed which other organisations it may be disclosed to<br /> - consideration is given to whether consent of the data subject is required, and if so, will be sought [and complied with], unless there is a legal obligation that overrides this requirement  <br /> <br /> 6.4.3 <br /> Will develop procedures to address requests for further information, complaints and concerns raised by members of the public or by staff concerning the implementation of this guidance and any resulting information sharing agreements, procedures or guidance.<br /> <br /> 6.5 Information standards<br /> <br /> 6.5.1 <br /> Will ensure processes are in place to check the quality of the person identifiable information before it is shared.<br /> <br /> 6.6 Retention of shared information<br /> <br /> 6.6.1 <br /> Will ensure retention and disposal processes and schedules are agreed for the information being shared in line with statutory and organisational requirements.<br /> <br /> 6.7 Security of shared information<br /> <br /> 6.7.1 <br /> Will take responsibility for restricting access to person identifiable information that they process and the secure exchange of person identifiable information in line with principle 7 of the Data Protection Act (see appendix 1 and for further guidance see the international standard ISO 27001). <br /> <br /> 6.7.2  <br /> Will set out standards for the technical security arrangements that must be in place to protect shared information during transfer and within partner organisations.<br /> <br /> 6.7.3 <br /> Will ensure that all personal identifiable information is transferred in line with national security guidance and protocols.<br /> <br /> 6.8 Access to personal information<br /> <br /> 6.8.1 <br /> Will ensure that any impact on the ability to provide the public with access to their information is considered to ensure that the Data Protection right of individuals to seek access to their health or social care record is upheld.  <br /> <br /> 6.9 Freedom of Information<br /> <br /> 6.9.1 <br /> Will ensure that this guidance and any resulting information sharing agreements will be included in the organisations Freedom of Information Act Publication Scheme.<br /> <br /> 7 INFORMATION SHARING AGREEMENTS/PROTOCOLS<br /> <br /> <br /> 7.1 <br /> Information sharing is essential in order to provide effective services and protect the public.  Information sharing agreements are one way of ensuring that those organisations involved in information sharing have considered all the potential information governance issues around this sharing and are adhering to the current legal framework around information sharing.  <br /> <br /> 7.2 <br /> Not having an information sharing agreement does not mean that information cannot be shared.   As long as information sharing is being carried out legally, information sharing can occur.  This approach is supported by the Information Commissioners Office who states that &ldquo;All organisations can accomplish information sharing lawfully by adhering to governing legislation and the principles of the Data Protection Act whether an Information Sharing Protocol is in place or not.  An Information Sharing Protocol is a useful tool in some circumstances.  It is not a legal requirement&hellip;..An Information Sharing Protocol is a useful tool with which to manage large scale, regular information sharing &hellip;. It is not a useful tool for managing the ad hoc information sharing which all practitioners find necessary&rdquo; <br /> <br /> 7.3 <br /> A number of key factors relating to specific areas of information sharing should be considered and documented.  This may be in the form of an information sharing agreement, but could be documented in other ways e.g. spreadsheet, database etc.  It is up to those organisations involved in the information sharing to agree the most effective method for their organisations.  What is important, is that all of these areas have been considered prior to the sharing of this information.<br /> <br /> 7.4 <br /> Table 1 details the areas which should be considered for routine sharing of person identifiable information.<br /> <br /> 7.5 <br /> The importance of the security of the information shared during transfer and whilst within organisations can not be overemphasised.  The Data Handling Review highlighted the need to minimise the storage of, and access to person identifiable information on removable media, such as laptops, computer discs and memory sticks which may be lost or stolen. It stated that where the use of removable media is unavoidable, encryption will be used and the information to be transferred will be the minimum necessary to achieve the business purpose. It also reported that where there is any reason where encryption cannot be applied, such material will be afforded physical protection using similar risk assessment processes as for large amounts of public money or precious objects.  It also stressed the need for improved security assessments/processes for IT systems which hold person identifiable information.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TABLE 1<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> AREA FOR CONSIDERATION        DESCRIPTION<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Contacts                                             Designated individuals within the sharing organisations responsible for sharing of the information<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Information to be shared                Type of person identifiable information to be shared, and whether sensitive.
